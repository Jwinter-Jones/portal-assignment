       <p>Howdy Everyone, it's James Winter-Jones here and welcome to my website! Stay as long as you'd like, I hope you like it. If you're interested in who I am,
         take a look below and I'll tell you all about me. See ya down there!
       </p>
       
       <p>I was born in Tacoma, WA in 2000 and have been raised here all my life. I had some college experience back in 2019 to 2020 in learning computer programming
         at CPTC. But now, I'm here in Year Up's Software and Development Track and on my way to a 6 month internship! My main language is Java, but I 
         am knowledgable in .Net Framework, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL as well. My current career goal is to become either a software developer or database developer.
       </p>
       
       <p>What have I done with my experience? Mainly little side projects for now but I have some WIP projects going on at the moment. 
          My main goal is to make data driven applications using my knowledge of SQL and Microsoft Sql Server. Along with data driven applications,
           general coding solutions to idea's that I find intriguing, which I can't tell you because spoilers. Why do I do what I do?
           You'll find that answer written below.
       </p>
       
       <p> What drives me to do what I do? Well that's a loaded question, but there are many factors to why I chose this path. For one, I like excercising and 
         coming up with new logic to create solutions people haven't before. It's like art almost, it takes from reality and mixes with the person to create
         something new and different. I think there are plenty of canvases to paint, so I wish to be someone who can paint on them. Along with where I come from 
         and being the first in my family to enter the tech field, that's mainly why.
       </p>
